@@@ Metallb enable on minikube @@@

Create a Minikube kubernetes cluster first

then,

Once the cluster is ready, you need to install the metallb addon:

minikube addons enable metallb

Then, you have to configure metallb by giving it an IP address range.
For instance check your minikube IP with minikube ip and choose how many IP addresses you need.

minikube ip
192.168.49.2

As an example, we choose the range 192.168.49.100-192.168.49.120.
Configure the addon with those values.

minikube addons configure metallb
-- Enter Load Balancer Start IP: 192.168.49.100
-- Enter Load Balancer End IP: 192.168.49.120
     Using image metallb/speaker:v0.9.6
     Using image metallb/controller:v0.9.6

  metallb was successfully configured
