To create a system user or system account, run the following command:
sudo useradd \
    --system \
    --no-create-home \
    --shell /bin/false prometheus


You can use the curl or wget command to download Prometheus:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.32.1/prometheus-2.32.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz


Then, we need to extract all Prometheus files from the archive:
tar -xvf prometheus-2.32.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz


Usually, you would have a disk mounted to the data directory. For this tutorial, I will simply create a /data director. Also, you need a folder for Prometheus configuration files:
sudo mkdir -p /data /etc/prometheus


Now, let's change the directory to Prometheus and move some files.
cd prometheus-2.32.1.linux-amd64

First of all, let's move the prometheus binary and a promtool to the /usr/local/bin/. promtool is used to check configuration files and Prometheus rules.
sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/

Optionally, we can move console libraries to the Prometheus configuration directory. Console templates allow for the creation of arbitrary consoles using the Go templating language. You don't need to worry about it if you're just getting started.
sudo mv consoles/ console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/

Finally, let's move the example of the main prometheus configuration file.
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml


To avoid permission issues, you need to set correct ownership for the /etc/prometheus/ and data directory.
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/ /data/

You can delete the archive and a Prometheus folder when you are done.
cd
rm -rf prometheus*

Verify that you can execute the Prometheus binary by running the following command:
prometheus --version

To get more information and configuration options, run Prometheus help.
prometheus --help


We're going to use some of these options in the service definition.
We're going to use systemd, which is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. For that, we need to create a systemd unit configuration file.
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

To automatically start the Prometheus after reboot, run enable.
sudo systemctl enable prometheus

Then just start the Prometheus.
sudo systemctl start prometheus

To check the status of Prometheus run following command:
sudo systemctl status prometheus

Suppose you encounter any issues with Prometheus or are unable to start it. The easiest way to find the problem is to use the journalctl command and search for errors.
journalctl -u prometheus -f --no-pager
